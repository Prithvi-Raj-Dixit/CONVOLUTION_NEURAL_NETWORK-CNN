# CONVOLUTION_NEURAL_NETWORK-CNN

This repository contains python code to show the images from already taken dataset
It contains all necessary modules and packages needed to show the image . I have used VSCode as IDE for the execution of the codes, So VSCode is highly recommended but you can use other IDEs also.
